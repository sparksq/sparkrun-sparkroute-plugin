"""Public model-card metadata published on bridge endpoints.

Implements the producer half of ``SPARKRUN_MODEL_METADATA_CONTRACT.md`` in the
SparkRoute repository.  Sparkrun already knows what each local runtime
serves; this lets the gateway's ``smallest`` / ``largest`` / ``lowest_cost``
selectors use that, instead of an operator hand-authoring size, price, context
and tag values a second time.

The extension is **advisory and additive**.  It cannot register an endpoint,
add a logical model, enable a disabled one, change routing weight, or deliver a
credential — and the gateway discards invalid metadata while keeping the
inference endpoint.  So the rule here is that nothing in this module may make a
valid endpoint unpublishable: :func:`build_model_metadata` returns ``{}`` rather
than raising, and every field is dropped unless it is known and valid.

Three properties are load-bearing:

* **Report, never infer.** An unknown field is omitted; a model-family default
  would be a plausible number with no source, and the gateway would rank real
  deployments against it.  ``context`` in particular is the *effective* runtime
  limit from the recipe's config chain, not the nominal family limit.
* **Offline.** This runs inside the one-shot ``gateway-bridge`` subprocess on
  the inference path, so it reads only what the recipe already carries.  It
  never fetches from HuggingFace — ``model_params`` is present precisely when a
  previous VRAM estimate wrote it back into recipe metadata.
* **Bounded and public.** Sizes are capped per the contract, and only
  presentation-safe values are emitted.  Secrets, credential references,
  endpoint URLs, raw model-card JSON and error text must never appear here;
  everything below is derived from a fixed set of numeric/enum recipe fields.
