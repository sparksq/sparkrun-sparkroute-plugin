"""Project sparkrun's recipe catalog into the gateway's ``sparkrun`` managed set.

The contract is `SPARKRUN_MANAGED_CONFIG_HANDOFF.md` plus
`SPARKRUN_MANAGED_CONFIG_RESPONSE.md` in the llm-gateway repository; the
sparkrun-side replies are in ``docs/SPARKROUTE_MANAGED_CONFIG_RESPONSE.md``.

Three properties are load-bearing and each has a failure mode behind it:

* **Catalog, not discovery.** A binding is projected whether its workload is
  ready, stopped, or was never started. Generating deployments from live
  endpoints would deadlock — an offline workload would delete the very
  ``activatable`` deployment the gateway needs in order to start it again.
* **Deterministic.** Array order participates in the gateway's content
  revision, so an unstable ordering would produce a new revision (and a new
  runtime generation) on every reconcile even when nothing changed. Every list
  here is sorted, except ``cluster_candidates``, whose order encodes placement
  preference.
* **Self-contained.** Generated entities reference only generated entities.
  Referencing an operator entity would let their edits block our deletions.
