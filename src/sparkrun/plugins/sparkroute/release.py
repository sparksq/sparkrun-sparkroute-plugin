"""On-demand acquisition of the SparkRoute release binary.

The LiteLLM gateway is acquired at start time by shelling ``uvx --from
'litellm[proxy]==<pinned>' litellm`` (see :mod:`sparkrun.proxy.engine`), so
"fetch a pinned third-party runtime when the gateway starts" is already how
this layer behaves.  SparkRoute is a Go binary rather than a Python package,
so this module is its ``uvx``: resolve the current platform, fetch the matching
release asset from GitHub, and verify it before it is ever executed.

Two rules make this safe enough to run a downloaded binary with the operator's
privileges, and neither should be relaxed:

* **Pinned version, pinned digest.** A sparkrun release names exactly one
  SparkRoute version and carries the SHA-256 of every asset it will accept.
  A platform with no pinned digest is a hard failure, not a download — "we
  don't know what this should hash to" and "run it anyway" must never be the
  same code path.
* **Verify before execute.** The download lands in a private temp file and is
  hashed *before* anything is unpacked from it; the binary only becomes
  executable once its archive matched.  A partial or tampered download is
  never left somewhere that looks like a usable binary.

**Assets are archives, not bare binaries.** SparkRoute publishes
``sparkroute_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`` (``.zip`` on Windows) holding the
executable alongside its licence and notice files, and its ``checksums.txt``
digests those archives.  So the pinned digest is the *archive's* — it is the
value the release actually publishes, and pinning the unpacked binary instead
would mean pinning a number nobody else can independently confirm.

That is also why the verified archive is kept in the cache next to the binary
it produced: the pinned digest is then re-checkable on every call against a
file we still hold, which is the property the bare-binary layout used to have.
Extraction never trusts a path from the archive — the single member is located
by name and streamed to a destination this module chooses — so a crafted
archive cannot write outside the cache directory.
