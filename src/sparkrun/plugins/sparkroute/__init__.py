"""LLM Gateway integration — sparkrun-supervised Go gateway, both directions.

An in-tree plugin (see :mod:`sparkrun.plugins`) because it is only coherent as
one unit while fitting no single extension point. It contributes:

* **Outbound** — :class:`~.engine.SparkrouteEngine`, registered as the
  SparkRoute gateway. Sparkrun acquires the pinned release binary
  (:mod:`.release`), manages private live admin/caller token files
  (:mod:`.credentials`), starts the gateway in SQLite configuration mode, and
  replaces its managed set through the admin API (:mod:`.admin`) from a
  projection of the binding catalog (:mod:`.projection`).
* **Inbound** — the hidden ``sparkrun gateway-bridge`` command
  (:mod:`.cli`), a one-shot JSON stdio protocol (:mod:`.protocol`,
  :mod:`.bridge`, :mod:`.operations`) the gateway drives as a child process to
  discover, activate and stop workloads.

Both halves are gated by one flag, ``gateway.sparkroute``, off on every
channel — and it gates *loading*, not just use: with it off this module is
never imported, so there is no gateway registration and no bridge command. One
flag rather than a separate presence flag because the two are not
independently useful: no point loading the plugin if the gateway will not be
used, and none in enabling the gateway without the plugin.

If disabled while a gateway is running, SparkRun's generic supervisor retains
process-level status and stop. Configuration and bridge operations require the
integration to remain enabled.
